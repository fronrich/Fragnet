# Build

These are essentially the blueprints for building the parts of the fragnet system. The functions in this directory are not run by the installer, but instead are copied into parts of the system itself, including nodes, the oracle, and reapers. If you're looking for functions that are used to install parts of the system, look in the `utils` directory.
